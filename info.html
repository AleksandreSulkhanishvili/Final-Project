        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability
            with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports
            multiple
            programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional
            programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
            library.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
            — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
            displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
            etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

        <h2>C++</h2>
        <p>
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to
            be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be
            adapted to multiple platforms.
